# Blind Drivers - Solutions Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Blind Drivers project! Our team is committed to developing a cutting-edge solution to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings confidently. By combining technology, machine learning, and wearable devices, we aim to address real-world challenges faced by people with visual impairments.

## Features
- **Obstacle Detection:** Utilizes TensorFlow Lite models to detect and alert users about obstacles.
- **Fall Detection:** Implements MPU6050 sensor for accurate fall detection and user safety.
- **Navigation Assistance:** Provides real-time navigation feedback through vibrations and alerts.
- **Wearable Device:** Integrates seamlessly with a wearable belt for hands-free operation.
